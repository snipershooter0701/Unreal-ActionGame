Hello and welcome to ActionRPG Game project for Unreal Engine 4.

Note:
It is more or less compatibile with latest master branch from official UE4 repo.

It is under heavy development, sweeping, copatibility breaking changes are to be expected. 

Replication/Multiplayer support is currently rudimentary, though it works, 
there is noise advanced prediction. it just dot naive prediction of let client do whatever and then
server override it (since server still have 100% authority).
