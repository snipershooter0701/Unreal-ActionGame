	Though of course setting up gameplay tags is bit of hassle, they should be able to give

	Another thing. I don't like the fact that inventory and other things are updated by OnRep_ functions.
	They work, the problem is that state of client side inventory is not updated until OnRep function is fired.

	I have to add some simple client side prediction. Especially for looting. Here it can easily cause out of bounds 
	errors for array if UI is updated to late and player click on item, which is not already in inventory.

	Or.. I can just check for valid index in array.
